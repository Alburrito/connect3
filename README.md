Another Tic-tac-toe in ASCII and Python that I made once I was bored. And to top it off with code in Spanish


## Installation

Just clone the repo:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Alburrito/connect3.git
```

Then go to connect3/connect3 directory and execute:

```sh
$ python3 connect3.py
```


## Usage example

When the game starts, the title screen appears where you enter the names of the participants:

![index](img/index.png)

To select the box, coordinates are requested (from 1 to 3) counting from left to right and from top to bottom:

![game](img/game.png)

At the end of a game, the victory counter increases and you can choose to play a new game or end the game:

![replay](img/replay.png)



## Development setup

No dependencies are required. Just Python3.
